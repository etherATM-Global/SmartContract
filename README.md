A Smart Contract is a computer-programmed code containing a stringent set of criteria that must be satisfied before a transaction will be approved. Reconciliation of these transactions are performed by a global collection of computer 'nodes' that are volunteered for service by human and corporate entity 'miners' (the computer owners) who are members of the Ethereum Blockchainâ€™s globally distributed network infrastructure.
